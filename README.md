# twitter-collect

## Objective

Basic applications made for doing request to obtain followers and accounts followed by entered twitter users.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.6** It's not guaranteed previous versions will work

* **SQLite** 

## Run it!

You'll need to run it locally. so just clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/falopez10/twitter-collect.git
```

After that, you must check the file: *hidden.py*. It contains the necessary keys to run the console apps. You have to replace these values in order for the programs to properly work.

Finally, just run one of the two apps: **twfollowers.py** and **twfollowing.py** (Guess what each one does :blush: ). You can see the results on console or on your favorite SQLite DB browser.

## Technologies used:

* **python:** Recommended language for data scrapping and data analysis.

* **Twitter API:** The application consumes services from twitter's API.

* **SQLite:** Light relational Database. Used for storing data and caching results.
